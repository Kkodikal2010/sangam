Konkanis are a small community worldwide already and shrinking because of inter-community marriages. Konkani, as a language and as a cultural community, need to be preserved, so our Konkani Saraswat identity is preserved for future generations.

“Sangam” is a small effort to ensure the continuity of our Konkani Saraswat language and culture - developed for eligible Konkani Saraswats from around the world  of marriageable age and with the intention to get to know each other and hopefully find their suitable match. Looking for a Konkani Saraswat match will be a 3-step process:

Registration: Register your details in the form below. (Only if you are a Konkani or have a Konkani background/roots.)
Verification: Someone will contact you personally and will verify the information that you provided, including checking if you are a Konkani or have a Konkani background. 
Access to prospects: Once you are verified then you will be able to access suitable prospects who have registered and have been verified.  

Note: 
Sangam is not responsible for:
Whether the person you are interacting with is a Konkani or has a Konkani background.  
The outcome of the interaction you have with prospects, in terms of any emotional, social or financial implications.
The success of the subsequent alliance.
